### Data layer : `src/data`
- `src/data/base.ts`: Data repository abstract base class
- `src/data/data.ts`: Single tone data layer class instance, this will be used as a the only interface that services will interact for data
- business specific data repositories
  -   `src/data/car/car-repository.ts`: Car repository class
  -   `src/data/car/model.ts`: Car class
  -   `src/data/extra/extra-repository.ts`: Extra repository class

### Service layer: `src/services`
- `src/services/car-service.ts`, `src/services/extra-service.ts`: Business logic specific services that interact with both "data layer" and "UI layer"
- `src/services/context`: A react-specific context that glues services and UI layer seamlessly

### UI layer: `src/components`
A group of UI components

### Helpers: `src/helpers`
